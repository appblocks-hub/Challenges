# Challenges

# Welcome to DRY Days.

Here are the list of Blocks and GitHub Issues you can contribute to.

We will keep updating the list, so keep an eye out for it.

On each repository Block, you can see its issues and work on the ones with the #hacktoberfest tag attached.

Make sure to watch the videos from the ["What the T#CH"](https://hacktoberfest.appblocks.com/#techSection) section on our page.

If you wish to report bugs or give feedback, make sure to add them as a GitHub issue in its corresponding repository,
